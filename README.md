This was the first React project where I had to begin using React Hooks which I found to be incredibly powerful and useful. Having the ability to set states allows me to update the components and rerender them when necessary such as when the score finally reaches 16 and the game winning screen needs to appear on the page. I feel like I get a lot more control over how I want the website to function and operate after understanding how hooks work and I see how crucial it is to master utilizing them. Although this memory game was a simple application to build, I think it offered me a basic introduction to a fundamental aspect of React.

Decided to update my code and utilize an API to grab data for the cards instead of hard-coding everything. I wanted to practice fetching data from an API so I used https://acnhapi.com/doc which is a free API for all things related to Animal Crossing.
